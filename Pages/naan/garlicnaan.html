    <h3>Garlic naan</h3>
    <p>Garlic Naan bread is Indian leavened flatbread made with all-purpose flour and spiced with garlic. At restaurants, plain naan bread is usually brushed with garlic butter and served. However, in my recipe, garlic is infused into the bread dough instead and I also top the naan bread with garlic butter.</p>
