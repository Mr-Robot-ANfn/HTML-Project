    <h3>Bucatini Pasta</h3>
    <p>Bucatini, also known as perciatelli, is a thick spaghetti-like pasta with a hole running through the center. It is common throughout Lazio, particularly Rome. The similar ziti consists of long hollow rods which are also smooth in texture and have square-cut edges; "cut ziti" are ziti cut into shorter tubes.</p>
